We decided to wait, went home, snacked and came back an hour later. The place is very small, this is why they can't serve a lot of customers at once.I ordered Penne Primavera and my guy got the Sunday gravy or something like that. Both meal were good. Penne Primavera was nice balance of pasta with some tomatoes and spinach. I got the garlic oil sauce and it tasted good. I added chicken to it for $4. I must say the chicken filet was quite small compared to what I was exepcting, nevertheless it was delicious and worth the $4.I tried the Sunday gravy and it was more like spaghetti with meat sauce. We got linguini with it and it had a bit of a strange taste, perhaps because of the different meats in it. The waiter said it was one of their specials, but I didn't find it much special.I got coke to drink and they serve you a can of coke for almost $3 so this place is a bit on a pricey side. However without appetizers but with simple drinks and meals we paid under $40 (not including tip) for two people. So I'd say it's pretty decent for the price.By the way food is not as greasy as it appears in the photos provided on yelp. I was scared to come here coz I thought it might be bad due to photos.Also space is very limited so I imagine you can have group of 4 people max, otherwise it's too tight. It was too tight for both of us so I can't imagine how it is for big groups.I'd come back here again.

So, after a frustrating interaction with a neighbor who parked in our dedicated space, we hopped in the car and were on our way.If we didn't know what we were looking for we probably would have driven right past! Verrrry small little place, but also had a home-y mom and pop kind of vibe.We sat down and were immediately greeted with a half-loaf of warm crusty bread with a little side bowl of fresh chopped garlic for dipping. YUM.There seemed to be only one waiter for the entire restaurant which wasn't really a problem because there was only 10 or so tables. It was a tad frustrating how long we had to wait to have our orders taken, but only because we were STARVING and had looked at the menu online before we went.Food: I ordered the risotto which changes weekly, this week it was fresh spinach and artichoke heart. The BF ordered the black truffle stuffed gnocchi with a tomato cream sauce.At first I really liked my risotto, it was creamy and rich but was lightened with the spinach and artichoke heart. After a few more bites I began to get overwhelmed by the lemony-ness of the artichoke heart. Don't get me wrong, I liked it a lot, but it was very lemony.The BF said he really liked his gnocchi and he ate the entire thing so I'd say his dish was a success.Bill was around $35 for the two of us, with only water to drink.

And shockingly, it's in Santa Cruz, the land of god-awful restaurants.FYI this review is not going to say anything that's never been said, everyone knows this place is fantastic. If you live in Santa Cruz, have never eaten here, and ever drive past, laughing at all the people waiting in line outside, you were wrong. Those people are laughing at you. It is worth standing outside for an extended period of time (yes, it's so small you can't wait inside). So they don't take reservations, but isn't that part of the allure? Great marketing to build themselves up like that, I think. And also, at least there's no reservation book to keep track of; OpenTable ain't cheap.Besides, you just put your name down and for that 30 min to an hour you've gotta wait can we well spent at the bar at the Crepe Place. Lucky for the Crepe Place, there are weirdly no other bars in sight (what's up with that?). I swear, Lillian's keeps the Crepe Place open. Kidding, sort of. That place just kinda sucks, food wise. I just use them as my waiting place for Lillian's. Anyway, I disgress.This place has a hidden gem within a hidden gem, and that is their House Pinot. OMG. How did they find this? I want to know. Did some lucky wine rep walk in there, knowing he was holding pure solid gold, or did Lillian's track this shit down? It used to be on the wine list for $18, but recently they upped it to $22 per bottle. But still. $22 for a GOOD bottle of wine on a restaurant wine line? That's kind of unheard of. I died went to heaven the first time I went there and a friend steered us toward it. They serve it in adorable Italian style anti-wine glasses that are simple and classic. Best part is, if you don't finish it, they say screw the health department and let you take it home anyway. I hope my saying that doesn't bust that up...All of their salad dressings are amazing; I never order a side salad in restaurants, but always do here.Their specials are not to be missed. The only problem is, you're going to order the special, and it's never going to be on the menu again. And you will crave it, and want to cry. I'm talking Butternut Squash Gnocchi and Chicken Parmesan. These things I've never seen again, and you are lucky enough to be in there, and one of those, or both, are on the menu, GET THEM. And call me, and I'll be there in 5.If you want to be safe and fall in love with an item that is always on the menu, go for the Black Truffle Gnocchi with Cremini mushrooms. Any sauce is good with it, but I particularly enjoy the Pesto and also the Tomato Cream.If you've got a serious pasta lover on your hands, do it big with the Sunday Gravy, and get meatballs on top. Trust me. Sounds like too much food, but it's worth it. It's called a to-go box. Their homemade pasta is epic.They have Canoli and Tiramisu that aren't the best I've ever had, but definitely better than most of the versions I've found in Italian restaurants in Santa Cruz.This place will transport you. No joke. Every time I eat there, I have the same server, who seems straight out of the Bronx, Long Island, or maybe Jersey. I love her. For a few hours one evening, you will feel like this place is not on Soquel Ave, but in Little Italy. It's a hard thing replicate; you will only pay about $70 for two people to have a 3 course meal with wine but you will have taken a mini vacation.

Just warm comfort food that will fill us up.Yelp recommended Lillian's with it's high reviews and lots of regulars BUT it didn't mention in the first few reviews about the wait times for walk ins... so this is more of a review with a warning than really a don't go there type of review.We were excited because getting there wasn't at all hard and we found street parking right away at around 8pm. No one else was waiting, so we were also happy thinking that we would get seated pretty promptly...it was really chilly outside.But sadly, we had to wait for over 45 minutes for a table...and not because people were sitting around and no one was leaving... 4 parties were seated before us. 4.Lillian's has an unconventional reservation/wait list that is listed on their website, but not communicated very well to walk ins.Apparently...if you know to call at 11am... you get on the wait list. And when a table becomes available sometime around your desired time, they will give you a call, and you can head down to the restaurant and be seated right away.This wasn't at all fair for those of us who aren't locals and don't know to call at 11am that day. Also, it seemed that all of the wait list folks were called BEFORE we were seated... it would seem more fair if maybe a walk in was seated for every 2 wait list tables.What ended up happening was we waited in the cold for about 15 minutes, until the host felt bad for us and had us sit in a corner of the restaurant for the next half hour. Wouldn't it also be nice if they had asked if they could take our drink orders during the wait? He did give us menus which was nice and appreciated.Once seated, our waitress was fine...nothing fantastic about the service... I got the feeling like she wasn't very interested in being overly friendly - and maybe that's just because this place was packed and very loud.The food was great - the food deserves 5 stars... but not the service. I had the Alfredo and it was buttery and really tasty...the chicken on my dish was moist and cooked really well. I had a taste from my friend's dish and it was also tasty.

He told us that all the recipes his mom's and that this is the food he used to eat as a child.The ambiance is great, very home-y: small, intimate, and kind of loud from all the talking.Let's move on to the food: As a vegetarian, or pescatarian I guess, my two favorite plates are the Lil's Kitchen Special, which is a baked penne pasta with a blend of delicious veggies and sauce. Second favorite: Prawns Diavola, spiciy prawns over your choice of pasta.My carnivore boyfriend LOVES the Sunday Gravy.For dessert: Must have the cannoli. \u00a0I've had tiramisu and wasn't that impressed, I don't think it had rum.As far as the wait time, since it's such an awesome restaurant, there's usually a wait time, but we usually put our names on the list, they take our cell phone #, we go to the Crepe Place down the street and have a drink while we wait for our table.

We had a group of 8 total and this place is ridiculously small! Our party of 8 definitely took 1/5 of the restaurant. I didn't even care though because of the wonderful service and the wait wasn't long since we called ahead.We ALL filled up on bread because it was warm and delicious. It comes with oil and vinegar and also they give you a little side of garlic if you'd like to add it to your bread. I loved it. A few of my friends ordered a side salad that was a very generous size! The salads come with a creamy balsamic dressing. I regretted not ordering it!We also ordered a $30 bottle of red chianti wine that was SOOO GOOD. I guess at other restaurants it could go for $40-50 so I was really satisfied about that.It was incredibly difficult to decide what to order for everyone but finally we got it together. My hubby ordered the Lasagna and I ordered Arrabiata Pasta. Since my pasta did not come with meat, I ordered a side of 2 sausages, peppers, and onions for $6.95. WOW IT WAS HUGE. I can definitely see why it was $6.95. They also have 1 sausage, peppers, and onions for $3.95. My pasta was only $9.95! My hubby's lasagna was $13.95 and he really loved it.Our entire bill for 7 people (last person didn't eat) and a bottle of \u00a0$30 wine was $167 before tip. So it was VERY decent for our meal.

Now, i save it for special occasions because you will generally have to wait for a table. A couple saturdays ago i had some friends visiting and we had time and just wanted a good hearty meal. I decided to take them to Lillian's figuring we could grab drinks somewhere while we waited. One of the owners told us it would be an hour wait. Okay no problem, \u00a0we went down to the crepe place and had a bottle of wine. We checked back after 50 or so minutes. He looked disheartened and overwhelmed by how many people were waiting outside the door, and inside tables were still occupied. \u00a0He told me he still had nothing available. He was apologetic and we waited. I could see it was not his fault, \u00a0sometimes people want to take 3 hours to finish a plate of pasta holding this little eatery up. Nevertheless we got hungry and impatient as time went on. We got a little crabby but tried not to direct it at the host. Finally by the time we got in he bought our bottle of wine. That was taking initiative to make his customers happy. We really appreciated that. What a nice man. However i was hungry and irritable, i figured i would enjoy my meal and leave and not come back for a while simply because of the wait. \u00a0Our Italian server (another owner) attended to us shortly after we sat down and received bread and water. She brought wine glasses with her to open our wine. I felt like i wanted to bark my order at her because we were starved. She personally apologized for our wait and reassured me that the wait rarely exceeded the estimate by that far. She was very friendly and patient with us hungry monsters so we finally calmed down because of her grace. You could tell that she was well informed with every aspect of the night, and that her and the other owner were personally working together to please every customer in the packed restaurant. She had his back! That kind of efficient teamwork and care is rare and special. We had an AMAZING dinner and experience after all. We left happy and full. I was reminded that life sometimes teaches you patience in various ways and this time it was shown through a pretty smile and elegance. I admire this family for their success and was shown that night how much they care and therefore deserve every person that walks through those doors. \u00a0When we left i personally thanked nas and joe for being patient with us too!

This place is so good I crave it after having dinner there!! I honestly haven't had a dish I didn't like however I do have my favorites!As stated in other reviews, they don't take reservations so be prepared to wait. The wait can be anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours. Try to call ahead if you can. It's a small restaurant with about 12 tables, dim lighting and tends to be very loud.The food is awesome!! The bread served is always warm, crusty,soft and chewy. Tables have olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt, pepper and Parmesan cheese. The bread's served with crushed garlic and all ingredients make a great dipping for the bread!!Appetizers: On occasion we will order an appetizer when were with friends or family and its always the Sauteed Mushroom Bruscetta. Crimini mushrooms sauteed in olive oil, butter and garlic. Served warm over grilled bread topped with crumbled Gorgonzola cheese and roasted red bell peppers. AMAZING!! I don't know what they do to their mushrooms but they are soooo good!!Salads and Soups: De-lish! Add a soup or salad to your entree for $2.95. Both the pesto vinaigrette and creamy Gorgonzola dressing are great. The soup is homemade and so good. Pasta fiagoli, similar to minestrone but way better!! A light tomato broth with chard, carrots, celery, beans and pasta. I believe there's some Parmesan cheese in it as well. It is so good and comforting on a cold night!Now onto pasta's favorites:~Sunday Gravy: Meat Sauce tossed with your choice of pasta and served with two meatballs. YUM! I usually get the penne but sometimes I get it with Ravioli. Being italian and growing up eating Sunday gravy every Sunday this is a great fix when I'm craving it!!~Pasta Primavera: Not your average primavera!! Grape tomatoes, sauteed crimini mushrooms, spinach and red onions tossed with your choice of sauce and pasta. My usual penne with either their pesto or with garlic and oil. You also have the option of adding steak, chicken or prawns. I always go with their prawns. Their so good! Cooked perfectly and plump! Again, I don't know what they do to their mushrooms but they are so good!!~Lillian's Penne &amp; Broccoli; Penne pasta tossed with broccoli, garlic and olive with a touch of chicken broth.

Sunday gravy is just a simple meat sauce, but I think they put some magic in there because we couldn't stop eating it. If I were at home, I would seriously lick the bowl! \u00a0:) \u00a0The 2 meatballs weren't enough because I could eat probably 2 more since they were so good. \u00a0The homemade pasta just made this meal even more fantastic. \u00a0I loved this dish! :)I ordered the Chianti along with the meal, and I thought that it wouldn't go well with the prawns, and I was right. \u00a0But the Chianti did go well with the pasta dish. \u00a0I was too full for dessert, so the next time I go, which I hope is soon, I will order the dessert and will yelp about it.Keep in mind that the waitresses were so accommodating. \u00a0Your water glass was never empty. \u00a0Your food arrived promptly. \u00a0And they served your food with a smile.Don't forget to call ahead when you want to eat here because if you don't, then you will be waiting for a long time. \u00a0However, if you do wait for 2 or more hours, I think the food is worth your patience! \u00a0Go here, seriously!", "restaurant_alias": "lillians-italian-kitchen-santa-cruz", "funny-count": 0, "cool-count": 1, "useful-count": 6, "date": "2/14/2011", "name": "Leddee H."}

The best part was that they give over 7-8 HUGE prawns in the dish. I'm used the 4-5, but seriously, the dish was so huge...I couldn't even finish it. I loved my dish.2.) Sunday gravy with fettucine dish with 2 extra meat balls. Yummy! The bf ordered this and he loved it. I would recommend it to all you meat lovers. It's good!3.) Filet mignon with raviolis - My sister's bf ordered this. I loved their raviolis. You can tell the ravioli's were fresh...they melted in your mouth. He did mention that he thought his meat was too salty, so you might want to lay off this one if you are trying to cut back on your salt intake.4.) Scampi dish - My sis ordered this and it was to-die-for! I love prawns as you can tell. Their warm, mouth watering, white sauce is SO good.

After hearing about the crazy wait times, we decided to call ahead. The owner picked up when my friend called, and I could hear him repeatedly interrupt her on the phone when she tried to talk. After telling us that he didn't take reservations, but he would put our name down for 7:15 because that was when the list started and then hung up. He never asked for our names, and when we arrived around 5:30 there was already a list made up. Though the owner was a dick, everyone else there seemed pretty nice. After we arrived we were told that our wait would be 35 minutes and they'd call us (on our phone) when they were ready for us, and that's exactly what happened.A big deal has been made over how big the portions are, and I have to say I disagree a bit. It seems like what kind of portions you get are fairly random; the person who spent the most on their food received a fairly small portion and the person who paid the least had a pretty large amount. Some of us were were incredibly stuffed, with food to spare, and some of us barely were full. \u00a0I ordered the fettucini alfredo, and thought it was the best I'd ever had (but a somewhat small portion), but my 3 friends generally thought the food was just \"better than average\" or \"mediocre\". It wasn't all that cheap either: 15 dollars is a lot to pay if you end up getting a smaller mediocre dish.Overall, the food is probably some of the best within a hour or two, but the owner is a dick and you really have to be careful what you order if you really to get a large portion of something good.", "restaurant_alias": "lillians-italian-kitchen-santa-cruz", "funny-count": 0, "cool-count": 0, "useful-count": 1, "date": "8/23/2011", "name": "c k."}

The soup of the day was similar \u00a0to minestrone a vegetable soup. Our main courses were both pastas with penne noodles. One was penne with broccoli served with a saucy marinara sauce, it was a good sized portion with fresh crunchy broccoli. \u00a0The second dish was a spicy sauce with chicken added, the name escapes me.

Again, he said he'd call.We had an appetizer and couple beers at The Crepe Place, that took about an hour. We started to head back. There were 3 other couples waiting outside (not the same people waiting earlier). We asked if he had called our name, he hadn't. Okay, it had to be any second now. Then, he proceeded to invite the other couples in. Huh? Golf Host, I know you don't take reservations and these people were not here before us.We sat. Our waitress was a zombie.

She has had a lot of stuff going on in her life that was stressing her out. After reading Yelp reviews, I thought this place would be nice to go to (keywords: comfort food).Looking for parking was kind of awful. That intersection just sucks. But then we saw the Free Parking and hit ourselves in the head for being so oblivious. Yay for almost getting killed twice today.Anyway, upon entering, I noticed that the tables were set up very close to each other. Kind of reminds me of Cafe Brazil in terms of how close the tables are to each other. I guess it's difficult to create maximum seating in a small location.The service was friendly and helpful. We didn't know what poached eggs were, so we asked, and our server didn't know, but checked for us.We had the Egg Siciliano, Penne Margherita, a side of meatballs, and one cannoli to share. The Egg Siciliano was awesome. The bread was toasty and the egg (which we realized we knew what it was, just didn't know the term for it) was nice with the marinara sauce.My pasta was good. I really liked the sauce, but other than that, it is pasta. I think it would have been nice with fresh mozzarella (in the mini ball form, mmm... one of my favorites) and more basil.The meatball was tasty, a little spicy. I'm usually not a big fan of meatballs, but this one was flavorful.Now for the cannoli, neither of us have had one before and we didn't really like it. Maybe it's an acquired taste. Since we've never had it before, we had no reference point to whether it was good or bad.All in all, this place is pleasant to go to. I'll definitely go back to get some Egg Siciliano, which is a really nice brunch dish.As far as price, I feel like some dishes are worth it (Egg Siciliano) and some are not so much (Penne Margherita). I'll have to try their other pasta dishes to test their value, but for what it is, it's a little on the pricey side.In summary, this place has good food in good sized portions. It did it's trick in terms of comfort food (though I think I ate so much I was uncomfortably full).

The polenta was perfectly cooked, cloud-like really, and the country gravy, their name for bolognese, was meaty with a nice amount of both sweetness and spice. The meatballs were good, not fantastic, but good, and complemented the rest of the dish. My date's gnocchi was also delicious in that it was sufficiently pilloesque and melt-in-your-mouth good.

They actually came out a couple times to fill our water glasses. That was nice.Inside the place is pretty small and a little cramped. There's only about 10 tables. They bring you bread right when you sit down with some chopped garlic on the side. The bread is warm and you can dip it in olive oil and balsamic with the garlic - yum!Wine by the glass is comparable to other restaurants. Beer is actually cheaper than most places.I had Lasagna and it was really good. The green salad before with the Balsamic Vinaigrette Pesto was really good too. My boyfriend had the Arrabbiata with polenta and meatballs. It was spicy and on the border of being too hot but he liked it. My friend had the pesto pasta which she liked as I did too - I had to taste it. Overall I would say it's authentic Italian food.

The vibe is very friendly, neighborly. Some nice artwork on the walls, although the decor was a bit sparse. Could use a few more knick-knacks to make the place feel a little more lived-in. Also, the acoustics were such that there was a bit of an low roar all evening from the folks (ourselves included) chatting at each table. It wasn't uncomfortable, just a little louder than it seemed it should have been for such a small place.But the food and the service were both very recommendable. Well, the complimentary bread they set on the table right away was very basic; I think just plain French bread, served with butter (instead of olive oil?). But it was fresh and the butter was room temperature, so it was easy to spread. We ordered the Sicilian Lemon and Orange Dipping Salad to go with our bread. Think of it as an Italian style salsa, with citrus zing instead of chile spice. Quite good, very refreshing. My girlfriend especially enjoyed the orange chunks that had been marinating in the seasoned olive oil at the bottom of the bowl.For our main course I had a concoction that was whipped together after they ran out of their main special of the night. It was essentially lasagna with penne in place of the standard flat lasagna noodles. I really like it. It was light and flavorful, and actually tasted like fresh tomatoes, unlike the standard heavy Chef-Boy-Ar-Dee style of lasagna sauce.My girlfriend had their alfredo special with gorgonzola and chives. The alfredo was also light and flavorful, not weighed down with pounds of cream. It also would have had sauteed mushrooms but she doesn't eat those (so sad).We shared a cannoli for dessert.

First, its extremely regional and second home style Italian food is a mix of what grandma could mix with her hands and what was growing fresh in grandpa's garden, Lillian's has caught that tradition and now shares it with the general public.

My girlfriend and I ordered two dishes, the Sunday Special (w/meatballs) and the Gnocchi with black truffles in white pesto sauce.-The Gnocchi was a real disappointment, as the flavor and salt of the pesto overpowered the truffle and I could really only taste it in one or two of the gnocchi themselves.-The Sunday special was your a-typical red sauce with meat. Nothing truly special about this dish since we both thought we could make it at home.

I had the house salad and the meatball sandwich. Salad would have benefited from some croutons in my opinion, but otherwise it was fresh and delicious. It was also well chopped, no huge pieces of lettuce to contend with. My meatball sandwich was perfect. These are meatballs like Momma used to make, not hard lumps, but perfect, slightly spicy orbs of goodness. (If you have ever had Sestri's rock hard meatballs, you know what I mean) The house gravy (red sauce) was really good, and the sandwich is served on a nice sliced roll with melted mozzarella cheese. Wow! My partner had the house soup, which she enjoyed. It had white beans, pasta and kale, with a sprinkling of cheese on top. For dessert we each had a cannoli.

We come down off the mountain and arrive at the restaurant about 4:30. The owner greets us at the door and thanks us for venturing out on such a wet and stormy day. The menu is two pages of fine choices. My honey chooses Seared Ahi, our friends have Shrimp with Penne and Black Truffle Gnocchi in red sauce and I asked the owner to surprise me with his choice. I had the best Pasta Fazoole sp? soup ever and a nice Gorgonzola stuffed Gnocchi with a rare marinated and thinly slices NY steak fanned on top. The soup was perfect, each ingredient had personality (it was not all cooked to mush) I added a sprinkle of chili flakes at the owners suggestion...perfect rainy day helper. The Gnocci's were tender and the sauce was perfect. Everyone including our \"Old Country\" Northern Italian friends were saying is was \"good Dago food\" which I believe is a true compliment. The Owner and his sons run this family owned jewel and it is well worth a visit. Word of mouth travels fast and I suggest you get there quickly before everyone else finds out.
